# Sofle RGB Build Guide (Part 1)

![Sofle RGB Split Keyboard](/assets/images/sofle-rgb.jpg)


This guide serves as a way to document my experience building the 
[Keyhive Sofle RGB][keyhive-sofle] split keyboard. I'll include notes and images 
where appropriate to help guide any other lost soul, shouldyou wish to thread this 
path as well.


# TL;DR
I did a thing; I built a DIY split, column staggered, ortholinear keyboard. The
Keyhive Sofie RGB called to me, I answered, and begun writting notes on the trials
and tribulations of building and configuring this thing.

This is part 1 of X, because I realized that I had way too much to put into one
entry. Part 1 covers soldering the components and basic flashing for testing your
LEDs and keys after everything is soldered.


# Motivation

**So, why on Earth did I decide not just to build a keyboard kit, but a split one
at that??** Well, for one, I wanted to get my hands a little dirty and not just
buy a complete/pre-made keyboard. Besides, some of these bad boys can be pretty
pricey! Also, underneath it all, I also wanted to learn to type. That's right, 
I never learned to type proper, and have learned to rely on part muscle memory
and part quick hen-pecking to get the job done. It would be nice if I actually
learned to type like I should have all those years ago!

**So why split keyboard?** I have heard wonders about using the split keyboard form
factor and the saving grace that may save repetive action injuries (like typing)
and carpal tunnel, so I decided to give it a try.

**OK, well why build your own?** Well, I love to tinker, and I wanted to work on
something that had an end-goal to it; I'm good at picking and working at pieces
separately, but I need more practice creating something useful from all said bits.
Besides, I had a largely unused RadioShack soldering iron (yes, **THAT** RadioShack)
so I decided it was time to do some dirty work.

**Let me clear up something from the start**; this isn't a from-scratch build.
I'm not that much of a genious yet :). For this, I bought a DIY kit from Keyhive
called the [Sofle RGB][keyhive-sofle], which incudes at it's most basic a pair of 
PCBs, FR4 plates, and bottom covers. All the DIY bits and pieces are included, such as 
the LEDs (underglow and per key), diodes, Kailh sockets, rotary encoders and knobs,
TTRS jacks and reset buttons. Alright, enough of this; on to the build notes!

# A Helpful Note...

There is a point in the [guide on soldering the leds][underglow-leds] where
there is a reference to `test each LED as you go`. For quite a while, I had no idea what
this meant, as the guide isn't terribly clear on this. There were two specific things that
I did out of order/different from the guide that I thought would be noteworthy: 1) LED
order consideration, and 2) Flashing and soldering the controller before soldering the
LEDs. This may be quite obvious to the experts among us, but it took me way too long to
figure this out during my build.

I've included a [Gotcha](#gotchas) section below with relevant information once you get
to it in the build guide.


# Build Guide

The [build guide][build-guide] for the Sofle RGB should be fairly straightforward, 
but there can be a few gotchas for the soldering uninitiated (like I certainly 
consider myself to be). Based on the most current commit of the guide (as of the
publishing date of this post, Aug 5, 2021); step \#1 requires soldering the majority
of the kit's included components up front. For this step, I cannot say this enough;
**be patient, go slow, and check your work often**.

Begin by lightly tinning (placing a small amount of solder) on the pads for all the 
components in this step. Additional notes below.

#### üëâüèΩ Diodes
Tin one side of the pad for the intended diode, and verify the correct position of 
the diode. Solder and position the diode, and once satisfied, solder the other side 
of the diode.

#### üëâüèΩ Underglow LEDs
These can be a pain, because of the relatively tiny terminals on the LED that needs
soldered. I found it helped to tin all four pads if the PCB where the LED is intended
to sit, and line the LED on top, verifying the corrent orientation. Then lightly apply
some pressure on the LED, and carefully flow the pre-applied solder to each terminal on
the LED. See [LED Order Gotcha](#led-order) below for some tips. For testing as you
solder, see [Flashing/Soldering Gotcha](#flashingsoldering-controller) for tips on
getting setup.

#### üëâüèΩ Per-Key LEDs
Same procedure applies, really. I lightly tin all contacts, place the led in the
appropriate orientation, appl light pressure, and then flow the solder.
See [LED Order Gotcha](#led-order) below for some tips. For testing as you
solder, see [Flashing/Soldering Gotcha](#flashingsoldering-controller) for tips on
getting setup.

#### üëâüèΩ Kailh Hotswap Sockets
This is pretty straightforward; just proceed as instructed in the build guide.

At this point, you should pretty much have a working keyboard! Slap some switches
on it, and then use a keyboard tester like [VIA Online][via-online] to test that all
the positions work. If you find that a key isn't working, recheck your soldering by
reflowing the connection, and making sure that none of the pins on the switch were
bent on seating the switch. Again, be patient and take your time!

We're almost done soldering!

#### üëâüèΩ Reset Button
You got it! Solder the reset button! Make sure that the button is soldered on the 
top of the PCB for easier access. You'll need this button to reset the controller
before flashing updated software to it.

#### üëâüèΩ OLEDs
As for the controllers, I opted to use sockets so that I could remove and replace
them at leasure without worrying about frying the PCB trying to remove them.

**Note that opting to use sockets will make it necessary to use longer standoffs to
put the OLED covers that come with the kit (~12mm; these standoffs are not included
in the kit).**

#### üëâüèΩ TTRS Jacks
As it says on the tin.

#### üëâüèΩ Encoders
These shoud be straightforward; just follow the guide!

#### üëâüèΩ Switches
Seat your switches of choice onto the hotswap sockets, taking care not to bend the
pins as you do.

# The End (of Part 1)

Finally! The moment of truth! Install your switches and test as you go along. But
at this point, you may have to reflash your keyboard so you can update to the
proper firmware, one which includes proper support for the encoders and weird
layout (you know, because of the encoders!).

Tune in to Part 2 of this build guide to follow along with the firmware side of
this journey!

# Gotchas

#### üëâüèΩ Flashing/Soldering Controller
The only way to test the LEDs as you solder them unto the the PCB, is to plug it in.
And the only way to plug your little Frankenstein of a keyboard in to flash and then
solder the controller onto the PCB. For one, note that it is possible to install the 
controller the wrong way. My build uses the [Elite-C v4][elite-cv4] controller, and
I completely missed the correct orientation from the photos in the build guide. This
lead me to panic into thinking that I burned the controller, and desperately trying to
desolder the controller from the PCB.

**Save yourself the trouble and use a socket to install the controller.** 
[Mouser Electronics][mouser-electronics] is a great place to source these components, 
and I used these [sockets][sockets] and [pins][pins] to seat the controllers, making
it easy to remove and replace in the future.

To flash the controller, you'll need the [QMK Toolbox][qmk-toolbox] and a firmware file.
For this first round all you want to test is your LEDs, so a proper keymap isn't quite 
necessary just yet. Flashing the controller should be fairly pain-free using the
 [QMK guide on flashing][firmware-flashing]; when asked for a firmware to flash, use the
one [provided by Keyhive][sofle-rgb-firmware] as a starting point for testing.

#### üëâüèΩ LED Order
LED order was another thing that bypassed my synapses completely. When I first started
installing the LEDs (after figuring out that I could/should install the controllers
to test the LED) I though I burned some of the LEDs as warned in the guide. **Here's
the thing; LED order is important in testing.** Meaning that the LEDs are connected in
series, and if the LED isn't connected to the one before it, it will not light. Use the
[LED order image][led-order] included in the guide for installing the LEDs, beginning
with the undeglows. Be patient, don't linger on the iron wehn soldering, and test as
you go. All will be well.
