***Reading time: {{ page.content | reading_time }}***

Often times in the fury of the current tasks ahead, I find myself making small
leaps of progress. and as is customary, I forget to document these little
victories for later use.

This blog, **What I Typed Today**, is intended to take care of this problem.
It is meant as a way to document the things that I learned, or reasoned about,
so that I no longer have to reply solely on memory (except to know that it is
documented here :)). My hope is that this will help any other developers,
experienced and novice alike. If you have any comments, feel free to
[drop me a line](mailto:tlcommodore@gmail.com)!
