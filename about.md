Concept to delivery Web/Software Application Developer, on solo and in team
environments. I spend my time on front and back end development and web micro
services using Ruby/Ruby on Rails, React/Flux, Java/Play Framework,
Nodejs/Express, and most recently Clojure.

Before my role as a developer, I spent 8+ years as an astronomer scripting for
space science in Integral Field Spectroscopy/Unit (IFS/IFU for the James Webb
Space Telescope) and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) using Python.
